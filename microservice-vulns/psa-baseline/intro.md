# Pod Security Admission (PSA) Baseline Enforcement

In this scenario, you will learn how to:

- Create a namespace with Pod Security Admission (PSA) enforcement
- Apply the Pod Security Standard (PSS) at the baseline level
- Test the enforcement by creating a Pod that violates the baseline restrictions
- Understand how PSA prevents insecure configurations

This scenario demonstrates Kubernetes' built-in security controls and how they can be used to enforce security best practices at the cluster level.
